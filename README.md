# TileMemoryGame
Just a java tile memory game in Java files containing tiles not provided
in the scope of this project it is a 10x10 grid.

However if you have a folder containing 50 different .Gif files 32 x32, that should do the trick. you will also require a blank tile.

a memory game where you need to match pairs of tiles. 
Playing is very simple - you turn over one tile and then try to find a matching tile. 
When you click on the first tile of a turn and you have exposed a matching tile in a previous turn, 
a message tells you that the pair is known.

I incorporated 2 different styles of play a timed version(2 and 10 mns) and a no limit version.
